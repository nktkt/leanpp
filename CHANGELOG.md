## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-29

Patch release on top of v0.1.1: a missing-feature fix in `spec def`
plus two CLI conveniences for state hygiene.

### Added

- `spec def` now threads its `decreases EXPR` clause through to the
  generated `def` as `termination_by EXPR`. The clause was already
  parsed in v0.1.0-mvp but its value was dropped; now it actually
  reaches Lean's well-founded-recursion checker. This unlocks
  `spec def` for non-structural recursion (e.g. recursing on a
  custom-ordered tree) where the user must supply a measure.
  `examples/insertSorted.leanpp` already had `decreases xs.length`
  in its surface form; with this fix it elaborates as well-founded
  rather than being silently discarded.
- `leanpp clean`: remove `**/*.transpiled.lean` from cwd recursively.
  With `--all`, also wipe `.lake/` and `build/`. Always reports what
  it touched.
- `leanpp doctor`: diagnose missing tools / project state / LeanPP
  reachability. Probes `lake env lean` with an `import LeanPP` test
  (and dereferences `LeanPP.Trust.obligationAttr`) to confirm the
  stdlib is on the search path. Exits non-zero on any issue. Useful
  as a post-clone smoke check.

### Tests

- `tests/smoke_cli.sh` covers both new commands. Suite is now
  29 / 29 (11 elaboration + 18 CLI).

[0.1.2]: https://github.com/nktkt/leanpp/releases/tag/v0.1.2

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-28

Post-MVP polish: CI infrastructure, surface-syntax linter, env-walk
diagnostics, extended `auto`, two more examples, and an `unsolved`
attribute synonym that resolves the `obligation`-as-keyword conflict.

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs
  `lake build` and `tests/run.sh` on every push and PR. Uses
  `leanprover/lean-action@v1` to provision the toolchain pinned in
  `lean-toolchain`.
- README badges for CI, License, and Lean version.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` covering setup, repository layout, the four
  non-negotiable rules, code style per language, and a prioritized
  what-to-work-on list keyed against `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- `#laws` command (`LeanPP/Spec.lean`): enumerates every `@[law]`-tagged
  theorem in the current module, marked `[proved]` or `[open]` depending
  on whether it uses `sorryAx`. Mirrors the shape of `#obligations`.
- `#obligations` now filters to current-module decls (was scanning the
  full env, including imports). `#laws` does the same.
- `examples/Queue.leanpp`: FIFO queue concept with a two-list amortised
  implementation. Demonstrates `concept` with explicit carrier
  parameter, an `instance` discharging laws, `@[law]`-tagged free-
  standing theorems (one proved, one open), and `#laws` / `#trust IDENT`
  diagnostics in concert.
- `bin/leanpp obligations FILE.leanpp` and
  `bin/leanpp trust FILE.leanpp [--ident IDENT]`: env-walk path that
  transpiles the file, appends `#obligations` / `#laws` / `#trust`
  commands, and runs `lake env lean` so the diagnostics inspect the
  *real* elaborated environment instead of grepping source. Without a
  file argument both commands keep their grep-based source-scan
  fallback for fast project-wide overview / lake-less environments.
- `bin/leanpp-transpile` now ships a surface-syntax linter:
  - Catches misspelled clause keywords inside `spec def` bodies
    (`ensure` → `ensures`, `require` → `requires`,
    `decrease` → `decreases`, `implmentation` →
    `implementation`, …) and emits editor-friendly diagnostics
    `file.leanpp:LINE:COL: warning: ...`.
  - Catches `specdef` / `spec_def` / `spec  def` (extra space) typos
    at top level as errors.
  - Errors when a `spec def ... by` block has no `implementation`
    sub-block.
  - `--strict` flag escalates warnings to errors and skips writing
    output. `--no-lint` disables the check.
- `tests/smoke_cli.sh` exercises the lint (catches `ensure`,
  `specdef`, and `--strict` exit code). Suite is now 26 / 26 PASS
  (10 elaboration + 16 CLI).

### Changed

- `auto` is now a two-stage portfolio: an `auto_core` of cheap closers
  (`rfl | assumption | contradiction | decide | omega | simp_all |
  leanpp_auto_simp_set | trivial | apply And.intro <;> auto_core ;
  done | exact Nat.zero_le _`) and a wrapper that retries `auto_core`
  after `intros` so quantified ensures-clauses can close.
  `leanpp_auto_simp_set` is a small Nat / Int simp lemma list
  (`Nat.zero_le`, `Nat.le_refl`, `Nat.add_zero`, `Nat.zero_add`,
  `Nat.div_le_self`, `Nat.mod_le`, `Nat.div_mul_le_self`,
  `Int.natAbs_neg`).
- `spec def`'s generated proof now tries `auto`, then `unfold NAME;
  auto`, then `intros; unfold NAME; auto`, then `sorry`. Each branch
  is wrapped in `(...; done)` so `first` cannot accept a branch that
  simplifies the goal but leaves it open. This was a real bug: the
  prior `first | auto | (intros; auto) | sorry` would silently swallow
  partial progress and emit `unsolved goals` instead of falling
  through to a `sorry`-backed obligation.

### Fixed

- The `safeDiv.ensures_1` postcondition in `examples/trust.leanpp`
  (`result * d ≤ n` where `result = n / d`) now closes automatically
  via `Nat.div_mul_le_self` after the spec macro inserts `unfold
  safeDiv`. Sorry-warning count across the example suite drops from
  10 to 9.

### Examples

- `examples/BST.leanpp`: an unbalanced binary search tree as a `Map`.
  Demonstrates the full Lean++ stack on a recursive structure:
  `concept Map`, an `inductive BST`, ordinary recursive `def`s for
  `find` / `insert`, an `instance` discharging the concept, and
  three `@[law]` theorems (one proved, two open and dual-tagged
  `@[law, unsolved]`). Includes `#laws`, `#obligations`, and
  per-decl `#trust` calls. Test suite is now 11 elaboration + 16
  CLI smoke = 27 / 27.
- `@[unsolved]` attribute synonym for `@[obligation]` (`LeanPP/Trust.lean`).
  Both attributes are recognized by `#obligations`, the trust
  ledger, and `bin/leanpp obligations`. The synonym exists because
  `obligation` is also a top-level command keyword (`obligation
  NAME : PROP`), and Lean's attribute parser refuses to parse it
  inside an `@[...]` list without the `«obligation»` guillemet
  escape. `unsolved` is a non-keyword alias that fits naturally,
  e.g. `@[law, unsolved] theorem foo : ... := by sorry`.

[0.1.1]: https://github.com/nktkt/leanpp/releases/tag/v0.1.1

## [0.1.0-mvp] — 2026-04-28

First public release. Implements the Phase 1 MVP scope from
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

### Added

- **Surface language** (`LeanPP/Spec.lean`):
  - `spec def NAME (ARGS) : T requires P ensures Q [decreases E] := BODY`
    lowers to `def NAME` plus one `@[obligation] theorem NAME.ensures_k`
    per `ensures` clause, closed by `auto`.
  - `concept NAME (α : Type) where ...` using Lean's native
    `structFields` grammar.
  - `obligation NAME : PROP` lowers to `@[obligation] theorem NAME := by
    sorry`.
  - `#obligations` enumerates every `@[obligation]`-tagged declaration
    with solved/unsolved status.
- **Refinement DSL** (`LeanPP/Refine.lean`):
  - `model NAME (...) where ...` aliases `structure`.
  - `implementation IMPL refines MODEL by tac` lowers to a
    `theorem IMPL.refines_MODEL : Refines IMPL MODEL` discharged by the
    user-supplied tactic (with a `trivialRefines` default instance for
    MVP).
- **Automation** (`LeanPP/Auto.lean`):
  - `auto` portfolio tactic: `rfl | assumption | contradiction | decide |
    omega | simp_all | simp | trivial`.
  - `auto?` no-fail variant.
  - `proofplan NAME strategy: ...` registers a callable named tactic
    via dynamic macro emission. Strategies: `normalize algebra`,
    `rewrite using IDENT`, `rewrite using [IDENT, ...]`,
    `close by simp | auto | omega | decide`.
- **Trust model** (`LeanPP/Trust.lean`):
  - `register_option leanpp.profile : String` with values `safe |
    research | systems | education`.
  - `#profile <name>` command.
  - `#trust` prints a current-module ledger (filters out imports so
    Lean core noise is excluded).
  - `#trust IDENT` prints a focused entry with transitive axiom walk.
  - `#assertSafe` errors if any user decl uses `sorryAx` or a
    non-baseline axiom.
  - `@[obligation]` and `@[law]` tag attributes.
- **Foreign / FFI scaffolding** (`LeanPP/Foreign.lean`): `verified
  extern` syntax that pairs `@[extern]` with a sorry-backed contract
  theorem tagged `@[obligation, ffi_contract, verified_extern]`.
- **CLI** (`bin/`):
  - `leanpp new`, `leanpp transpile`, `leanpp transpile-all`,
    `leanpp build`, `leanpp trust`, `leanpp obligations`,
    `leanpp --version`, `leanpp --help`.
  - `leanpp-transpile`: header injection, `by implementation/proof`
    desugaring, multi-line `ensures` continuation, profile passthrough.
    Default output suffix `.transpiled.lean` matches `.gitignore`.
  - `lake++` wrapper: `lake++ build`, `lake++ trust`, `lake++ ci
    --safe-profile` (fails build when `sorry > 0` or `unsafe > 0`),
    plus stubs for `proof-cache`, `minimize-imports`,
    `explain-broken-proof`, `theorem-index`.
- **Examples** (`examples/*.leanpp`): `abs`, `insertSorted`,
  `binarySearch`, `simpleParser`, `Stack`, `concepts`, `proofplan`,
  `trust`. All 8 elaborate cleanly through transpile + LeanPP.
- **Documentation** (`docs/`): MANIFESTO, COMPATIBILITY, TRUST_MODEL,
  SYNTAX_RFC, TUTORIAL, ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE, PROFILES, AI_PROTOCOL.
- **Tests** (`tests/`): `run_all.sh` (elaboration), `smoke_cli.sh`
  (CLI surface), `run.sh` (top-level runner). 20 / 20 pass.
- **CI**: GitHub Actions workflow runs `lake build` and `tests/run.sh`
  on push and PR.

### Phase 1 limitations (deferred to Phase 2)

- Inline `law` keyword inside `concept` / `model` bodies. The MVP uses
  `@[law] theorem ...` outside the body.
- `Refines` semantics: the stub class is always discharged by the
  default `trivialRefines` instance. Real refinement needs project-
  specific simulation relations.
- `lake++` proof-cache, minimize-imports, explain-broken-proof, and
  theorem-index are stubs.
- The `bin/leanpp trust` and `bin/leanpp obligations` CLI commands use
  grep-based scans. The Lean-side `#trust` / `#obligations` commands
  do proper environment walks.
- VS Code source map / language server integration is not in this
  release.
